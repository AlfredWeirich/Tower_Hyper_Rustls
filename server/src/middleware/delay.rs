//! # Artificial Delay Middleware
//!
//! Introduces a configurable fixed delay before a service reports readiness.
//! This is useful for:
//! - **Load testing** – simulating slow backends.
//! - **Timeout verification** – ensuring client-side timeouts trigger correctly.
//! - **Back-pressure simulation** – seeing how the stack behaves when a layer
//!   is slow to accept work.
//!
//! The delay is injected in [`poll_ready`](tower::Service::poll_ready), **not**
//! in `call`, which means the service will hold off accepting the *next*
//! request until the sleep completes.
