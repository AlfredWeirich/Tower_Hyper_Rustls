//! # Request Counter Middleware
//!
//! Maintains a global [`AtomicU64`](std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64) counter that
//! is incremented for every completed request. A log line is emitted at `INFO`
//! level every **500** requests (and the very first request) to keep the output manageable
//! while still providing periodic throughput feedback.
//!
//! ## Design Details
//!
//! * The counter is wrapped in an [`Arc`] so that all clones of the service
//!   share the same counter — useful when Hyper spawns one service clone per
//!   connection.
//! * Instead of boxing the future, this middleware uses a custom
//!   [`CountingFuture`] with `pin_project` to avoid a heap allocation per
//!   request.
