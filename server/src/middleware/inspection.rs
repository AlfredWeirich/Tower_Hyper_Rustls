//! # Path Inspection Middleware (Allow-List)
//!
//! This middleware acts as a lightweight WAF (Web Application Firewall) by
//! checking every incoming request's `(method, path, query)` triple against a
//! set of compiled regular expressions. If the request does **not** match any
//! allowed pattern, it is rejected immediately with a **403 Forbidden**
//! response, and a warning is logged.
//!
//! ## Performance Notes
//!
//! * On the **happy path** (request allowed), no heap allocations are
//!   performed — the method, path, and query are borrowed as `&str` directly
//!   from the request.
//! * On the **reject path**, strings are only allocated for the warning log
//!   line.
//! * A blocked request never reaches the inner service, saving downstream
//!   compute.
